## Implementation Details

### Environment Structure
- Main entrance with an interactive door
- Two separate exhibition rooms
  - Room 1: Physics Exhibit (Solar System and Gravity Demonstration)
  - Room 2: Chemistry Exhibit (Volcanic Reaction Demonstration)

## Room 1: Physics Exhibit
### Features
- Interactive Solar System display
- Gravity comparison demonstration table
- Components:
    - Main display table
    - Secondary table with reset button
    - Two interactive balls for gravity testing
    - Designated testing zones for different gravitational fields
### Interactions
- Ray-casting selection for objects
- Object manipulation through ray-casting
- Comparative gravity zones
- Physics-based interactions for gravity demonstration
- Reset functionality (applied but non-functional)

## Room 2: Chemistry Exhibit
### Features
- Interactive volcanic reaction demonstration
- Components:
    - Miniature volcano model
    - Two interactive bottles:
        - Soda bottle
        - Vinegar bottle
    - Chemical reaction visualization
### Interactions
